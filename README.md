# PID_controlled_LEGOEV3_UNMANED_VEHICLE
This is the file for project in ECE 556 Mechatronics.
The project required student using LEGO EV3 brick, motors, and other parts to design unmanned vehicle. Meanwhile, light sensors and ultrosonic sensor were applied to detect desired path and distance.
PID controller was required to perform path following, platooning, parking, objective detecting, etc. 
The programs were written in Matlab, where real-time connect was built between PC and EV3 brick to receive data and send commands.
